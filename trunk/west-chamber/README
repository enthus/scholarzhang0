Xtables-addons
==============

Xtables-addons is the proclaimed successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). It
contains extensions that were not accepted in the main Xtables
package.

Xtables-addons is different from patch-o-matic in that you do not
have to patch or recompile either kernel or Xtables(iptables). But
please see the INSTALL file for the minimum requirements of this
package.

All code imported from patch-o-matic has been reviewed and all
apparent bugs like binary stability across multiarches, missing
sanity checks and incorrect endianess handling have been fixed,
simplified, and sped up.
