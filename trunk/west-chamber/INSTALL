Installation instructions for Xtables-addons
============================================

Xtables-addons uses the well-known configure(autotools) infrastructure
in combination with the kernel's Kbuild system.

	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure CFLAGS="..." --prefix=/usr ...
	$ make
	# make install


Supported configurations for this release
=========================================

	* iptables >= 1.4.3

	* kernel-source >= 2.6.17, no upper bound known
	  with prepared build/output directory
	  - CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK or CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK
	  - CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK_MARK or CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK_MARK
	    enabled =y or as module (=m)
	  - CONFIG_CONNECTOR y/m if you wish to receive userspace
	    notifications from pknock through netlink/connector

Extra notes:

	* in the kernel 2.6.18.x series, >= 2.6.18.5 is required

	* requires that no vendor backports interfere


Selecting extensions
====================

You can edit the "mconfig" file to select what modules to build and
install. By default, all modules are enabled.


Configuring and compiling
=========================

./configure [options]

--with-kbuild=

	Specifies the path to the kernel build output directory. We need
	it for building the kernel extensions. It defaults to
	/lib/modules/$(running version)/build, which usually points to
	the right directory. (If not, you need to install something.)

	For RPM building, it should be /usr/src/linux-obj/...
	or whatever location the distro makes use of.

--with-xtables=

	Specifies the path to the directory where we may find
	xtables.h, should it not be within the standard C compiler
	include path (/usr/include), or if you want to override it.
	The directory will be checked for xtables.h and
	include/xtables.h. (The latter to support both standard
	/usr/include and the iptables source root.)

--with-xtlibdir=

	Specifies the path to where the newly built extensions should
	be installed when `make install` is run. It uses the same
	default as the Xtables/iptables package, ${libexecdir}/xtables.

If you want to enable debugging, use

	./configure CFLAGS="-ggdb3 -O0"

(-O0 is used to turn off instruction reordering, which makes debugging
much easier.)


Build-time options
==================

V= controls the verbosity of make commands.
V=0	"silent" (output filename)
V=1	"verbose" (entire gcc command line)


Note to distribution packagers
==============================

Except for --with-kbuild, distributions should not have a need to
supply any other flags (besides --prefix=/usr and perhaps
--libdir=/usr/lib64, etc.) to configure when all prerequired packages
are installed. If iptables-devel is installed, necessary headers should
be in /usr/include, so --with-xtables is not needed.
